This presentation is for my course project for the Coursera Developing Data Products.
The project required the development of basic R Shiny App. which is published to shinyapps.io.

The project dataset used is the data from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models). This app focus on cylinders, Transmission and  Gears


The Shiny App is accessible from here: https://len21.shinyapps.io/CarsApp
